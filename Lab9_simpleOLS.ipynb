    "\n",
    "#### The coefficient estimte for age:\n",
    "Looking first at the p-value (last column) we can see that p > alpha (0.05), therefore we fail to reject null.  This means that the coefficient for age is **not** significantly different from zero.  This is that horizontal line (slope == 0) that we saw on the scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### R-squared\n",
    "R-squared is negative.  R-squared technically shouldn't be negative - it's the square of correlation and therefore should be constrained to between 0 and 1.  However, the R-squared is soooooooooo low that the adjustment to not overstate the r-squared in the population makes it below zero.\n",

    "Let's take a look at what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The intercept:\n",
    "In this model with a single categorical predictor, the intercept is the mean of income for the reference category (in this case Females).  So the average income for females in the sample is about $47k.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The coefficient estimte for genderMale:\n",
    "Looking first at the p-value (last column) we can see that p < alpha (0.05), therefore we reject null.  This means that the coefficient for gender is significantly different from zero.  Gender is a significant predictor of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the variable is categorical, genderMale is like an on/off switch.  So we cannot interpret this coefficient the same way we would for a continuous/numerical predictor. Here, we would say as compared to the reference group (Female), Males earn, on average, $11,570 more than females.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F-statistic\n",
    "The F-statistic is our overall (omnibus) test of model fit.  It tells us:\n",
    "1. If our r-squared is significantly different from 0. AND\n",
    "2. If our model is significantly better than a \"null\" / \"empty\" / intercept only model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model our p-value is less than alpha, indicating that this model fits better than a null or empty model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Because we have only one predictor variable (parameter), the p-value for the t-test of the coefficient and for the F-test of the model are identical.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared\n",
    "R-squared is 0.02, which is very low, indicating that gender, while significant, does not explain much of the variance in income.  Because the F-test was significant, however, we do know that this r-squared is significantly different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Return to Top](#top)\n",
    "<a id = \"assump1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear in the Parameters / Errors are Independent\n",
    "The assumption of linear in the parameters says that the variables are entered into the model correctly.  We've entered gender as a single dummy variable (genderMale = 1 is Male, genderMale = 0 is Female).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to check if we have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) errors."
