    "## Big Brother\n",
    "Big Brother is a TV show in which groups of adults (typically 16 per season) are locked into a house (studio) for an entire summer (~80-90 days).  They are filmed 24/7 and in addition to 3 televised episodes per week, viewers can also watch 24/7 \"live feeds.\"  The \"houseguests\" are competing to win a half million dollars.  Each week one houseguest wins the head of household (HOH) competition.  That HOH nominates 2 HGs for eviction.  Those HGs have 1 chance to avoid eviction - the veto ceremony.  6 HGs participate in the veto ceremony - the 2 nominees, the HOH, and 3 other HGs based on random draw/HG's choice.  If the winner of the veto removes one of the nominees from \"the block\" the HOH nominates another remaining HG.  One of the two nominees is voted out each week during a live show, then the process is repeated on a weekly basis until 2 HGs remain.  A winner is voted on between those 2 remaining HGs, voted for by a jury of evicted HGs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I have obtained data on previous HGs from the last 21 seasons of regular US Big Brother, 1 special online season of US Big Brother (OTT), and 2 special shortened celebrity seasons.  This data was collected by Vince Dixon and made available on his github page.  You can see his methodology and his analysis of the data (specifically focused on racial dynamics) at https://vincedixonportfolio.com/2019/08/29/methodology-behind-big-brother-diversity-data-dive/.\n",

Because zero is a possible value of HOH wins, we can interpret this as the average number of days in the game (or the predicted/fitted value of days in the game) **when a player has zero HOH wins**.  So on average a player with zero HOH wins makes it halfway through about halfway in the game (52 of 99 days).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Our coefficient for HOH wins is 15.  This means that for each increase of one HOH win there is, on average, a 15 day increase in days in the game.  In a modern/recent season with 99 days, that would be about 2 weeks in the game - as each eviction cycle is 7 days.  So they would, on average, remain for 2 more cycles.  They cannot be evicted during the cycle in which they are HOH, so this represents an additional week on top of that, **ON AVERAGE**.\n",

    "5. The p-value associated with our F-statistic is significantly below an alpha of 0.05.  This means that the inclusion of our IV in our model significantly improves the prediction of tenure over a null model, or a model with no IVs (just using the mean/intercept to explain the variance).

So when a player has zero HOH wins and zero nominations they should last, on average, 37 days in the game.  This might not be considered interpretable, however, since you (typically) can't leave the game without being nominated.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Intercept** - The intercept is 38 days.  This is now the average days in game when number of HOH wins equals zero, nominations equals zero, **AND** gender is at the reference value (female).  So for a female with zero HOH wins and zero nominations, the average of days in game is 38.  However, as discussed previously, this is not meaningful as you typically cannot leave the game without being nominated.  This type of subtlety in interpretation is why it's important for the analyst to understand their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **total_hoh** - Same as above (with the addition of also holding gender constant), this is interpreted as the average increase in days in game with a 1 unit increase in HOH wins, _**holding all else constant**_.  So when we don't vary total nominations or gender, an additional HOH win is associated with an increase of about 12 days in the game.  This number is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the coefficient for total_hoh in the second model.  Remember this is the effect of HOH_wins when \"controlling for\" the other variables in the model.  This is a significant predictor (p < 0.001).  It is important to check the p-value for each coefficient in each model, sometimes the addition of another variable might cause your predictor to no longer be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **total_nominations** - This is also the same interpretation as in model 2, with a slightly different coefficient estimate, except now we're holding both total_hoh and gender constant.  Each nomination is associated with a 8 day increase, on average, of days in game, holding HOH wins and gender constant.  This coefficient also remains significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **gendermale** - This is the coefficient for \"gender == male,\" which we interpret with respect to the reference group, female.  So in comparison to females, males, on average, last 2 fewer days in the game.  However, with p = 0.38, gender is not a significant predictor of days in game.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **adjusted r-squared** - This model (the combination of all three variables) explains 50% of the variance in days in game. This r-squared is actually slightly lower than the r-squared we saw in the previous model (0.4978), which means that adding gender did not improve the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **F-statistic** - Remember this tests this model with three predictors to the null / empty model with ZERO predictors.  This model with three predictors is significantly better than a null model, but doesn't tell us if this model with gender as a third predictor is significantly better than the second model without gender.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But, we can test whether model 3 is a significant improvement over model 2.  In this case, model 2 is now the nested model, and model 3 is the full model."

An increase in one year of age is associated with an increase in 0.46 days in game, holding all else equal.  This is about half a day.  But you need to remember that just because this coefficient is smaller than the other coefficients, it doesn't mean it's a less important predictor.  A difference in one year of age is not comparable to winning 1 HOH competition or being nominated one time. If we wanted to know the impact of 10 year increase in age (for example, for a 20 y/o player vs. a 30 y/o player), that would be 4.6 day increase in days in game.  This is a reminder that we cannot compare the magnitude of the unstandardized coefficient estimates to determine effect size directly, we need to keep in mind how big that one unit increase in our x value represents.\n",

    "### Final Model Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intercept** - not meaningful because age cannot equal 0.\n",
    "2. **total_hoh** - each additional HOH win is associated with an average increase of 21 days in the game, holding all else constant.  This is independent of the impact of HOH wins squared.\n",
    "3. **total_hoh squared** - each additional increase of HOH win squared yields a decrease of 2.6 days in the game, holding all else constant.  Number of HOH wins squared is hard to interpret, but what is more important is that this is a significant predictor of days in game and reflects a downturn that when a player has more and more HOH wins it could start to negatively impact days in game - the relationship between HOH wins and days in game is not perfectly linear.  This could reflect a situation where as players are seen winning more competitions they're seen as a threat and then targetted for eviction.\n",
    "4. **total_nominations** = each additional nomination yields an average increase of 11 days in the game, holding all else constant. This is independent of the impact of nominations squared.\n",
    "5. **total_nominations squared** - for each increase of 1 nomination squared, there is an average decrease of 0.6 days in the game.  Again, similar to the hoh squared term, the 1 nomination squared unit is not interpretable; what is important is that this is a significant predictor and reflects that idea of \"diminishing returns.\"  This is accounting for what we mentioned earlier - nominations lead to eviction.  Even though you need to stay in the game to earn more nominations, so overall total nominations is associated with an increase of days in game, the more you're nominated the more chances you have to be ultimately evicted.\n",
    "6. **age** - for each increase of one year in age there is an increase of 0.42 days in game, controlling for total HOH wins, total nomination wins, and HOH wins and nomination wins squared..  Again, this is not a large number probably because a 1 year difference in age is not a large difference.  If we were interested in a 10 year increase in age we would multiply the coefficient by 10, so a 10 year increase in age would be associated with an average increase of 4.2 days in the game, holding all else constant.\n",
    "7. **r-squared** - Our final model explains 54% of the variance in days in game, which is really good for \"real world\" data.\n",
    "8. **Model F-test** - not surprising, this model is significantly better than a null or empty model."
